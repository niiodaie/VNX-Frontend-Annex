Issue: No way to recover/reset a password if the user enters the wrong one.

Fix:

If using Firebase Auth, enable password reset emails in Firebase Console.

Add a Forgot Password link on the login page.

When clicked, prompt for email → send reset email via:

javascript firebase.auth().sendPasswordResetEmail(email)

Show a toast/alert: “Check your inbox for a password reset link.”

✅ Add to roadmap: "Implement password recovery flow"

🧭 2. Mentor Change → Route Error

Issue: When trying to change mentors, app throws a route error (e.g. “page not found” or “forgot to add page to router”).

Fix:

You likely created a new route (e.g. /change-mentor or /mentor-select) but didn’t register it in your router file.

If using React Router, make sure it’s included:

jsx <Route path="/change-mentor" element={<ChangeMentor />} />

Check that the page/component exists and is exported properly.

✅ Dev Task: Register /change-mentor route in router

📝 3. Track Progress → Can’t Add Lyrics

Issue: Clicking “Track Progress” doesn’t let users add lyrics to their current journey.

Fix:

Check whether the component is interactive — possibly a disabled textarea or missing onChange handler.

There might be a missing field binding or the form isn’t saving to Firestore.

Dev Suggestions:

Ensure lyric input is editable and tied to state (e.g., useState or form lib).

On save: update Firestore with journey.lyrics field

Confirm auto-save or manual “Save” button works

✅ Task: Enable lyric entry + save logic under "Track Progress"

🎧 4. Inspiration Tab — All Buttons Unresponsive

Issue: Buttons like “Try this beat,” “Build a hook,” and “Collab with others” aren’t triggering anything.

Fix:

These may be placeholder buttons without click handlers, or linked features haven’t been wired up yet.

Open the InspirationTab.jsx or similar component and confirm each button:

jsx <button onClick={handleTryBeat}>Try this beat</button>

Then, make sure each handler does something — redirect to /beat-generator, open a modal, or fire an AI call.

✅ Action Steps:

Wire up buttons in Inspiration tab

Define click handlers for: Try this beat, Build a hook, Collab with others

Add loading states or placeholder content if full tools aren’t ready
