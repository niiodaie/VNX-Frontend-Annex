creating a database with all major artist in the world capable of providing mentorship on the darknote platform. this database should be be to auto update


ChatGPT said:
That’s a bold and visionary move — turning DarkNotes into the ultimate artist mentorship platform. Let’s break it down and set you up with a smart, scalable system that can evolve over time.

Goal: Build a Global Artist Mentorship Database for DarkNotes
💡 Auto-updating, AI-augmented, and ready to scale with real + cloned artists

Here’s the plan:

PHASE 1 — Database Design (Foundation)

Database: Use Firebase Firestore or MongoDB for flexibility (NoSQL is better for this structure)

Artist Schema (Example)

{ id: "artist_001", name: "Kendrick Lamar", genre: ["Hip-Hop", "Conscious Rap"], region: "USA", bio: "Pulitzer-winning lyricist known for storytelling and social commentary.", mentor_model: { available: true, clone_status: "AI", // "AI", "VoiceClone", "Unavailable" personality_profile: "thoughtful, layered, poetic", specialties: ["lyricism", "concept albums", "performance"] }, media: { image_url: "https://cdn.darknotes.com/images/kdot.png", sample_prompt: "Help me write a politically charged verse using metaphors and contrast." }, metadata: { spotify_id: "...", apple_music_id: "...", youtube_id: "...", source: "verified" }, auto_update: true, last_synced: "2025-04-11T10:30:00Z" }

You’ll be able to search, sort, and display artists based on genre, vibe, mentor availability, etc.

PHASE 2 — Auto-Update System

Option A: Pull from Spotify, Apple Music, Genius, or Last.fm APIs

Use Spotify API to search for top artists by region/genre

Pull bio, image, follower count, genres, etc.

Use Genius or Last.fm for personality traits and lyrical themes

Sync nightly using a scheduled job (Cloud Functions or CRON job)

Option B: Use Web Scraping (if APIs don’t offer enough data)

Scrape verified artist pages from Genius, Wikipedia, or AllMusic

Parse key attributes: genre, bio, vibe, keywords

Option C: Hybrid Model

Use Spotify to identify new rising artists

Use OpenAI/GPT to auto-generate mentor-style prompts and clone profiles from bios and discographies

Example:
Given “Tyler, the Creator” → GPT can infer his vibe, tone, creativity style, and generate a mentorship profile

PHASE 3 — Tools to Maintain & Scale

Admin Panel (Web dashboard to edit/update artist entries)

Auto-Tagger (AI that assigns categories & mentor themes)

Feedback Loop: Let users submit or request new artists

Sync Monitor: Track how fresh each artist record is

PHASE 4 — Rollout

Start with a pilot of 20–50 top-tier diverse artists (e.g. Beyoncé, Bad Bunny, Burna Boy, Billie Eilish, RM of BTS)
Then expand weekly using auto-discovery pipelines

Bonus: Add an “underground” flag for indie artists the system finds via TikTok, SoundCloud, or user input

Would you like me to generate the actual Firestore or MongoDB schema next?
Or build the sync script to auto-populate this database with real artist data from Spotify or Genius?
