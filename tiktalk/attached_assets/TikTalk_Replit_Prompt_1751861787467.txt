🚀 Replit Project Prompt: Build TikTalk MVP — A Modern Podcast Platform

🎯 Project Title:
TikTalk - The Home of Podcasters and Podcasts

📝 Description:
Create a fully functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for a podcast platform where podcasters can create and manage shows, upload episodes, and where listeners can browse, stream, and follow podcasts.

🎨 Target Audience:
- Podcasters looking for a simple, powerful platform to share their content
- Listeners seeking a clean, mobile-friendly podcast discovery and streaming experience

🔧 Core Features (MVP):
1. Authentication
   - Sign up / Log in with email & password
   - Creator profile setup (name, show title, cover image, bio)

2. Podcaster Dashboard
   - Create podcast show (title, description, category, cover)
   - Upload episodes (MP3/audio)
   - Add episode title, notes, cover image, tags
   - View basic analytics: plays, followers, episode count

3. Public Listener Interface
   - Homepage feed: Trending, New Episodes, Categories
   - Podcast Show Page: cover, description, list of episodes
   - Episode Page: in-browser audio player, share link
   - Follow/Subscribe to podcasters

4. Audio Hosting
   - Store and stream MP3 files via Supabase Storage or similar
   - Generate and expose public RSS feed per podcast

5. Design
   - Clean, modern UI using Tailwind CSS
   - Fully responsive and mobile-first
   - Simple, lightweight audio player (React-based)

🛠️ Stack Suggestions:
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase (Auth, Storage, Postgres DB)
- Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Supabase/Render (backend if needed)

📂 Folder Structure (Recommended):
/client      --> React app
/server      --> API logic if needed
/public      --> Static assets (logo, cover images)
/supabase    --> SQL schema + storage setup

📈 Stretch Goals (Phase 2):
- AI tools for auto-title/summary generation
- Monetization: listener donations, paid subscriptions
- Audiogram/video generator for social media
- Voice-to-podcast converter
- Commenting system under episodes
- Analytics dashboard with graphs

📌 Note:
Make it modular and clean. Focus on working core flows: Create show → Upload episode → Play episode → Follow.

📎 Deliverables:
- Working live preview
- Link to GitHub repo
- Optional: Branding preview (logo + color scheme)

Let’s go BEAST MODE on TikTalk MVP.
