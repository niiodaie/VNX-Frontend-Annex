Create a full-stack web app called Nexus Tracker for simplified project management — designed for solopreneurs and small businesses. This tool should help users manage:

✅ Projects & task boards

✅ To-do lists

✅ Reminders

✅ Linked AI prompts

✨ Target Outcome:
A clean, efficient, mobile-first platform — inspired by Asana and Monday.com, but simplified and built with a strong AI memory layer that lets users save, retrieve, and reuse previous AI interactions.

It should include polished UI/UX and default branding for the VNX ecosystem.

🔧 Tech Stack Requirements:
Frontend:

React (Vite scaffold)

TailwindCSS

Mobile-first responsive layout

Clean UI with board view, to-do list, and prompt history tabs

Backend:

Supabase (for auth, DB, storage) — integrated from the start

Use local fallback in dev if Supabase is not configured

AI Layer:

OpenAI API integration

AI helper sidebar for task suggestions, content generation, etc.

Prompt history stored per project/task

Hosting:

Target Replit deployment for full-stack hosting

Ensure all environment variables (API keys, Supabase URL) are clearly marked in .env

🎨 Design & UX (VNX Defaults)
Default font: Inter or Poppins

Rounded buttons and task cards

Responsive grid layout with fallback for mobile view

Sticky reminder bar at top: shows today’s tasks and upcoming deadlines

Use light theme with accent color in the VNX blue/teal range

Logo placeholder (VNX or Nexus Tracker) in top-left

Clean footer: “Built with 💡 by Visnec Nexus”

🧠 AI Prompt History Features:
Sidebar with input for new prompts

Save all prompts and responses in Supabase under current project/task

Allow user to search and recall past prompts

Allow AI responses to be reused or turned into subtasks or notes

🔁 Reminders & Sync:
Daily reminder logic (local + Supabase-stored)

Reminder bar with quick-view: “You have 2 tasks due today”

Add browser Notification API support (optional, fallback to UI badge)

📌 Additional Notes for Stability (based on past issues):
Ensure .env includes default fallbacks for development (e.g., mock Supabase keys if none provided)

Avoid hardcoding API keys — keep them in .env.example

Don’t use external Tailwind CDN — install via PostCSS

Set build script in package.json to:

json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
Ensure favicon is added in public/ and referenced in index.html

Structure UI into components early to avoid messy index files

✅ Optional Enhancements (Phase 2):
Multi-user support (invite by email)

Drag-and-drop task reordering

Calendar or Gantt view

Slack/email notifications

Export project summary to PDF or markdown

AI auto-summarize projects weekly
